# MY EXPERIENCE IN CONVID-19

*During the convid19 when the government said we will be under public emergency. I was sad, but when I remember the time I took to arrived at school and to also get back home usually makes me bored and tired.*

*I became happy because I can use the whole day to learn new things. No need to waste more time as I used to go to school.*

*Everyday I go to the college which is 10 minutes ride. I have my studies at the college from 9AM to 7PM each day except Sunday.* 
*These are the list of what I was learning and still now I am:*
